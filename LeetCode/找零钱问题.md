- 感觉没有多难的问题，就是做不出来啊，被自己蠢哭了。首先满脑子都是骚操作，想怎么写出来简洁好看，没有意思到解决问题是首要的，有功夫再慢慢优化嘛!
- 题目就长这个丑样子：  
> The new "Avengers" movie has just been released! There are a lot of people at the cinema box office standing in a huge line. Each of them has a single 100, 50 or 25 dollars bill. An "Avengers" ticket costs 25 dollars.
Vasya is currently working as a clerk. He wants to sell a ticket to every single person in this line.
Can Vasya sell a ticket to each person and give the change if he initially has no money and sells the tickets strictly in the order people follow in the line?
Return YES, if Vasya can sell a ticket to each person and give the change with the bills he has at hand at that moment. Otherwise return NO.
```
def tickets(a):
    n25 = n50 = n100 = 0
    for e in a:
        if   e==25            : n25+=1
        elif e==50            : n25-=1; n50+=1
        elif e==100 and n50>0 : n25-=1; n50-=1
        elif e==100 and n50==0: n25-=3
        if n25<0 or n50<0:
            return 'NO'
    return 'YES'
```
