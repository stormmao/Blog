- 按要求识别输入的姓名个数，并且输出相应的字符串
```
def likes(names):
    #your code here
    length = len(names)
    if length == 0:
        return 'no one likes this'
    elif length == 1:
        return names[0] + ' likes this'
    elif length == 2:
        return names[0] + ' and ' + names[1] + ' like this'
    elif length == 3:
        return names[0] + ', ' + names[1] + ' and ' + names[2] + ' like this'
    else:
        return names[0] + ', ' + names[1] + ' and '+ str(length-2)+' others like this'

- 比较好的改进，看起来更加规范
```
def likes(names):
    if len(names) == 0:

    elif len(names) == 1:
        return "%s likes this" % names[0]
    elif len(names) == 2:
        return "%s and %s like this" % (names[0], names[1])

- 高超的驾驭
```

    # of people who liked it.
    
    # {} indicate placeholders. They do not need any numbers but are simply replaced/formatted
    # in the order the arguments in names are given to format
    # {others} can be replaced by its name; below the argument "others = length - 2"
    # is passed to str.format()

    # d[min(4, length)] insures that the appropriate string is called from the dictionary
    # and subsequently returned. Min is necessary as len(names) may be > 4
    
    # The * in *names ensures that the list names is blown up and that format is called
    # as if each item in names was passed to format individually, i. e.
    # format(names[0], names[1], .... , names[n], others = length - 2
    return d[min(4, length)].format(*names, others = length - 2)
